description: Design on the open Fanta canvas
---

Work on the currently open Fanta design using the `fanta` MCP server.

User request: **$ARGUMENTS**

Call `get_editor_state`, `get_guidelines`, and `get_design_system`, then inspect relevant nodes with `batch_get`. Reuse the project's existing tokens and components. Use `batch_design` with its `ops` array for one visible component or section at a time. Report a stable agent identity with `report_agent_activity` and reuse it in `batch_design.activity` so Fanta can follow each streamed placement. Set `parent` or reparent nodes to create real nesting. Call `get_screenshot`, inspect the result, and fix visible issues. Fanta autosaves project files. Report what changed and any limits.

If tools are unavailable, explain that Fanta must be running with a design open and that this plugin expects `/Applications/Fanta.app/Contents/MacOS/fanta --mcp-stdio`.
