# Fanta plugin for Claude Code

This optional plugin connects Claude Code to the design open in the Fanta desktop app. It configures Fanta's `--mcp-stdio` bridge, provides a `/design` command, and bundles three workflow skills.

Install Fanta at `/Applications/Fanta.app`, launch it, and open a design project. Then run:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add jeanc18rlos/fanta-docs
claude plugin install fanta@fanta-docs
```

The plugin uses `/Applications/Fanta.app/Contents/MacOS/fanta --mcp-stdio`. For another install path or Fanta user-data directory, copy the connection command from the running app and configure the MCP command manually. The current server has 13 tools for canvas state and edits, design-system inspection, screenshots, FNX and managed JSON validation, image import, comments, and agent activity. Canvas edits appear one operation at a time while each batch remains a single undo step. Fanta autosaves.
